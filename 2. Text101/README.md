# Text101

A basic state-machine based text adventure exercise using scriptable objects in Unity.

This is the second project in the course where a storytelling game will be built and the theme is steampunk. 

This is first project where I'm exposed to the interaction of game elements in Unity with the C# code.

## The Storyline

### Who is the player?
Injured Airship Pilot

### What is the setting?
Small city under siege

### What is the threat?
The "Festers" (gangs of desert-dwelling scum)

### What is the goal?
Get airborne.

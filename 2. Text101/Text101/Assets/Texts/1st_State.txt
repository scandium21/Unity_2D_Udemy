I'm in the Emperor's chamber. It's 2 hours past midnight, I've got 1 hour to find the document. 
Suddenly, I heard foot steps comming towards me. Who could it be? I climb to the roof quietly and hide there.

It is the Emperor himself judging from the yellow clothes he wears. Damn. He must be too worried to sleep. 
He takes out a thin book from his chest pocket. No wonder I couldn't find the document, he had it with him!

How could I take a look at the document? I can:

1. Wait until he leaves.
2. Use martial art or drug smoke to put him to sleep quietly.

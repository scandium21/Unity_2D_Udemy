  storyText: "You know when to avoid unnecessary risks, that's why you carry the powerful
    sleeping potion with you all the time. All you need to do is to pour a few drops
    into the Emperor's teacup. \n\nYou move quickly on the roof into the room where
    servants prepare tea. Climbing down quietly, tap a few drops of potion into the
    tea pot, then back to the roof again. The servant is half asleep and far less
    alert than usual. \n\nNow the Emperor drinks the new tea, and 10 minutes later,
    he falls asleep. You climbed down, half hour has past, you open the booklet, read
    every word of it. In shock, you accidentally knocked off the teacup and the water
    spreads onto the booklet. Hearing the sound, the servant rushes in. You are about
    to be discovered, what to do?\n\n1. Hide underneath the chair\n2. Knock off the
    servant and leave"

  storyText: "There's no time to hide! You've got no choice but to use One-Yang Finger
    with great Inner Power so the servant wouldn't even understand what happened to
    him since he has no Kungfu at all.\n\nOk, you put him down. As you were about
    to leave, suddenly another person in black came out underneath the Emperor's chair.
    \n\nWho the heck is this person? You can't read the vibe, you don't know what
    to do.\n\n1. Get out of the Palace and send out the critical information on the
    booklet\n2. Ask the person about his/her business here"

  storyText: "Shit. You roll under the Emperor's chair to avoid the servant. Guess
    what? You're not alone there! There's a person also dressed in black and god knows
    how long s/he's been there. \n\nYou were in double shock now, but couldn't do
    anything but wait. The servant thought the Emperor fell asleep due to tiredness
    and knocked off the teacup. He swiftly cleans up the desk, and puts a blanket
    on top of the Emperor. They know better to not waken him.\n\nYou'd better leave.
    There's critical information on the booklet you need to send out. But who is this
    other person here? What to do with him or her?\n\n1. Leave him/her alone, get
    out yourself first\n2. Ask the person about his/her business here"

  storyText: "You're in the Emperor's chamber alone. It's 2 hours past midnight, you've
    got 1 hour to find the document. Suddenly, you hear foot steps coming towards
    the chamber. Who could it be? You climb to the roof quietly and hide there.\r\n\r\nIt
    is the Emperor himself! Damn. He must be too worried to sleep. \r\nHe takes out
    a thin book from his chest pocket. No wonder you couldn't find it, he had it with
    him!\r\n\r\nHow could you take a look at the document? You can:\r\n\r\n1. Wait
    until he leaves.\r\n2. Use martial art or drug to put him to sleep quietly."
